## 1. The Brand - 🌟 **The Origin of “Genaul” — A Name With Purpose**


#### 🌱 **Origin of the Name “Genaul”**

**Genaul** is a modern coined word built from two classical roots:

- **“Gen”** — inspired by *Gnosis* (Greek: γνῶσις), meaning **knowledge, insight, understanding**  
- **“Aul”** — drawn from *Aula* (Latin), meaning **hall, chamber, or place of learning**
